# View stream subscribers

Who is subscribed to a stream determines who receives the messages sent there.
All non-[guest](/help/guest-users) users can view public streams and subscribe
themselves. Organization administrators can
[configure](/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams) who can subscribe and
unsubscribe other users to streams.
