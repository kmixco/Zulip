# Self-hosted Zulip billing

This page describes how to manage your self-hosted plan, and answers some common
questions about plans and billing for self-hosted organizations. Please refer to
[Self-hosted Zulip plans and pricing](https://zulip.com/plans/#self-hosted) for plan
details.  If you have any questions not answered here, please don't hesitate to
reach out at [sales@zulip.com](mailto:sales@zulip.com).

## Paid plan details and upgrades

For businesses with up to 10 Zulip users, the Self-managed plan is a good
option, and includes free access to the Mobile Push Notification Service.

For businesses with more than 10 Zulip users, both the Basic and Business plans
include unlimited access to the Mobile Push Notification Service.

The Business plan also includes commercial support for dozens of features and
integrations that help businesses take full advantage of their Zulip
implementation. The minimum purchase is 25 licenses.

If your organization requires hands-on support, such as real-time support during
installation and upgrades, support for advanced deployment options, custom
feature development or integrations, etc., should contact
[sales@zulip.com](mailto:sales@zulip.com) to discuss pricing.

Paid plan discounts are available in a variety of situations; see
[below](#paid-plan-discounts) for details.

### Upgrades for legacy customers

Any Zulip server that registered for Zulip's [Mobile Push Notification
Service](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/mobile-push-notifications.html)
prior to December 12, 2023 is considered to be a **legacy customer**. Legacy
customers can continue using the notification service for free (no action
required) until February 15, 2024.

To continue using the service after that date, organizations with more than 10
users must upgrade to a paid plan or the Community plan. When you upgrade to a
paid plan, you can start the plan right away (if youâ€˜d like your technical
support to start immediately), or schedule a February 15 start date.

#### Do I have to upgrade my server first?

While upgrading your Zulip server to version 8.0+ makes it more convenient to
manage your plan, you do not have to upgrade your Zulip installation in order to
sign up for a plan. **The same plans are offered for all Zulip versions.**

In addition to hundreds of other improvements, upgrading to Zulip Server 8.0+ lets
you:

- Easily log in to Zulip plan management, without an additional server
  authentication step.

- Separately manage plans for all the organizations on your server.

- Upload only the [basic
  metadata](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html#uploading-basic-metadata)
  required for the service, without also [uploading usage
  statistics](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html#uploading-usage-statistics).

If you upgrade your server after signing up for a plan, you will be able to
transfer your plan to an organization on your server. If your server has one
organization on it, this will happen automatically. Otherwise, contact
[support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) for help.

## Free Community plan

Zulip sponsors free plans for over 1000 worthy organizations. The following
types of organizations are generally eligible for the free Community plan.

- Open-source projects, including projects with a small paid team.
- Research organizations, such as research groups, cross-institutional
  collaborations, etc.
- Education and non-profit organizations with up to 100 users.
- Communities and personal organizations (clubs, groups of
  friends, volunteer groups, etc.).

Organizations that have up to 10 users, or do not require mobile push
notifications, will likely find the Self-managed plan to be the most convenient
option. Larger organizations are encouraged to apply for the free Community
plan, which includes unlimited push notifications and support for many Zulip
features.

If you aren't sure whether your organization qualifies, submitting a sponsorship
form describing your situation is a great starting point. Many organizations
that don't qualify for the Community plan can still receive discounted Business
plan pricing.
