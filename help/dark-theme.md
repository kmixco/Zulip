# Dark theme

Zulip provides both a light theme and a dark theme, which is great
for working in a dark space.

## Manage color theme

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

{settings_tab|display-settings}

1. Under **Theme**, configure **Color scheme**.

The default is **Sync with computer**, which detects which theme to use based
on the color scheme used by your operating system.

You can also specify **Dark theme** or **Light theme** if you'd like
Zulip to use the same color scheme regardless of your operating system
configuration.

{tab|mobile}

{!mobile-profile-menu.md!}

1. Tap **Settings**.

1. Toggle **Night mode**.

{end_tabs}
