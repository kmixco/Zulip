# Disable welcome emails

{!admin-only.md!}

Zulip sends a handful of emails to new users when they join, telling them their
Zulip account details, and introducing them to the Zulip app. You can disable
these emails if they don't make sense for your organization. If you do so, you
will need to inform users how to log in to their Zulip accounts.
