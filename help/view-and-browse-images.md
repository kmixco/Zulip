# View images and videos

Zulip shows previews of attached images and videos, unless previews are
[disabled](/help/allow-image-link-previews) in your organization. You
can click on a preview to view an image in more detail, or to play a
video. Zulip also makes it convenient to browse all images and videos
attached to messages in your current view.

## Using the image viewer

## Using the image browser

In the Zulip desktop or web app, you can browse the images in the current view.
For example, if you're in a conversation view, the image browser will show all
the images from that stream. If you do a [search](/help/search-for-messages),
the image browser will show all images in messages that matched that search.

    to scroll through the images.
