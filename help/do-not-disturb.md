# Do not disturb

Zulip offers a Do not disturb (DND) feature that temporarily turns off notifications. For example, you can use it when you need to focus or take a break from work.
It will disable all notifications for private messages, mentions and alerts
for all the organizations that you have added to the Zulip app.

!!! warn ""

    DND may cause you to miss messages that require your timely attention.
