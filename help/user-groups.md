# User groups

User groups allow you to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) multiple
users at once, and add users in bulk to an existing stream or user group.
When you mention a user group, everyone in the group is
[notified](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) as if they were
individually mentioned.

Note that user groups are not the same as group direct messages. If you're
trying to send a message to a group of people, you'll want to either
[create a stream](/help/create-a-stream), or send a
[group direct message](/help/direct-messages).
