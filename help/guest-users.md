# Guest users

You can add users who should have restricted access to your organization as
**guests**. For example, this may be a good choice for contractors or customers
invited to a company's Zulip chat.

Guest users can:

- View and send messages in streams they have been added to, including viewing
  message history in the same way as other stream subscribers.

Guest users cannot:

- See private or public streams, unless they have been specifically added to the stream.
- Create new streams.
- Add or manage bots.
- Invite users to join the organization.

Zulip Cloud plans have [special discounted
pricing](/help/zulip-cloud-billing#temporary-users-and-guests) for guest users.
