# Guest users

You can add users who should have restricted access to your organization as
**guests**. For example, this may be a good choice for contractors or customers
invited to a company's Zulip chat.

Guest users **can**:

- View and send messages in streams they have been added to, including viewing
  message history in the same way as other stream subscribers.

Guest users **cannot**:

- See private or public streams, unless they have been specifically added to the stream.
- Create new streams or user groups.
- Add or manage bots.
- Add custom emoji.
- Invite users to join the organization.

You can also **configure** other permissions for guest users, such as whether they
can:

- [Move](/help/restrict-moving-messages) or
  [edit](/help/restrict-message-editing-and-deletion) messages.
- Notify a large number of users [with a wildcard
  mention](/help/restrict-wildcard-mentions).

Zulip Cloud plans have [special discounted
pricing](/help/zulip-cloud-billing#temporary-users-and-guests) for guest users.
