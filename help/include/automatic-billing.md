    Automatic billing is recommended unless you have a specific reason to
    choose manual billing.

With automatic billing, you automatically purchase a Zulip license for each user
in your organization at the start of each billing period (month or year), and
whenever you need additional licenses.

- [Deactivating a user](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user) frees
  up their license for reuse. No refunds are given for unused licenses
  you have purchased.

- If you have no free licenses when you **add a user**, you will be
  automatically billed for an additional license. You will be charged
  a pro-rated rate only for the remaining part of the billing
  period. Each month, you will see a single invoice covering all
  licenses added that month.

For example, suppose you start a billing month on a monthly plan with
15 users on Zulip Basic at $3.50/month. You'll be billed at the start
of the month for 15 licenses ($52.50). Suppose during that billing
month, you:

* Add 1 user five days before the end of the billing month. This requires
  one additional license, for a total of 16.
* Deactivate 4 users the next day, leaving you with 12 users and 16
  licenses.
* Add 6 more users on the second-to-last day of the billing month,
  bringing you to 18 users, and requiring 2 additional licenses for a
  total of 18.
* Deactivate 2 users on the last day of the billing month, leaving you
  with 16 users and 18 licenses.

Then, at the end of the billing month, you'll receive a single invoice
for 16 licenses at $3.50/month ($56, aka the initial purchase for the
next month) as well as the previous billing month's pro-rated
purchases of 1 license for 5 days and 2 licenses for 2 days, which
would add up to a total of just over $1.
