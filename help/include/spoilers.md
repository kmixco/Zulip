You can use spoilers to hide content that you do not want to be visible until
the user interacts with it.

Normal content in message

```spoiler Spoiler header
Spoiler content. These lines won't be visible until the user expands the spoiler.
```

The spoiler will initially display in a collapsed form:

Clicking the arrow will expand the spoiler content:
