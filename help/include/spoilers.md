## Spoilers

Here is an example of how you can use spoiler formatting in Zulip to hide some
or all of the content in your message until the reader chooses to reveal it.

### What you type

~~~
Normal content in message

```spoiler Spoiler header
Spoiler content. These lines won't be visible until the user expands the spoiler.
```
~~~

### What it looks like

The spoiler will initially display in a collapsed form:

![Spoiler collapsed](/static/images/help/spoiler-collapsed.png)

Clicking the arrow will expand the spoiler content:

![Spoiler expanded](/static/images/help/spoiler-expanded.png)
