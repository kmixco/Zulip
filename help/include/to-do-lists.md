Sending a message with the text `/todo` creates a simple collaborative
to-do list. Any user who can access the message can add tasks by
entering the task's title and description and clicking "Add task". Once
created, task titles and descriptions cannot be edited.

Tasks can be marked (and unmarked) as completed by clicking the
checkboxes on the left.
