## To-do lists

Here is an example of how you can start a collaborative to-do list in Zulip.

### What you type

Sending a message with the following text creates a simple collaborative to-do
list.

```
/todo
```

!!! warn ""

    The only content in the message must be `/todo`. Otherwise, the message will
    be sent as a regular message and the to-do list will not be created.

### What it looks like

![Markdown todo-lists](/static/images/help/markdown-todo.png)

!!! tip ""

    Tasks can be marked (and unmarked) as completed by clicking the
    checkboxes on the left.
