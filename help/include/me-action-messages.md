You can send messages that display your name and profile before a string by
beginning a message with `/me`. You can utilize this feature to send status
messages or other messages written in a similar third-person voice.

For example, if your username is **Ada Starr** and you send the message
`/me is now away`, your message will be displayed as:

```
/me is away
```
