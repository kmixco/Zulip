In Zulip, a **conversation** is a [direct message](/help/direct-messages) thread
(one-on-one or with a group), or a [topic in a
stream](/help/streams-and-topics). Use the **Recent conversations** view to get
an overview of all the ongoing conversations. This view is particularly useful
for catching up on messages sent while you were away.

{start_tabs}

{relative|message|recent}

   For example, select **Participated** to narrow to the topics you
   have sent messages to.

    The **Participants** column shows which users recently sent a message (newest on the left).
