For customers based outside of the United States, if you choose to pay by
invoice via an international SWIFT bank transfer be sure to **select "OUR"**
for who pays any transfer charges.

Otherwise, third party banking fees will likely be deducted from the amount
transferred resulting in the amount received being insufficient to cover the
total bill for your plan.
