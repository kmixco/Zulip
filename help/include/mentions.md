## Mentions

Here is an example of how you can @-mention users or user groups in Zulip.

### What you type

```
Users: @**Polonius** or @**aaron|26** or @**|26** (two asterisks)
User group: @*support team* (one asterisk)
Silent mention: @_**Polonius** or @_**|26** (@_ instead of @)
```

The variants with numbers use user IDs, and are intended for
disambiguation (if multiple users have the same name) and bots (for
the variant that only contains the user ID).
