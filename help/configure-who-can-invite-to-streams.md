# Restrict stream membership management

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, anyone other than guests can add other users to streams. However,
you can restrict the ability to do so to specific
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions). You can also can configure who can remove
other users from a public stream. For private streams, administrators must be
subscribed to the stream to configure these settings.

## Configure who can add users

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

1. Under **Stream permissions**, configure **Who can add users to streams**.

{!save-changes.md!}

{end_tabs}

## Configure who can remove users

{start_tabs}

{relative|stream|all}

1. Select a stream.

{!select-stream-view-general.md!}

   **Who can unsubscribe others from this stream?**

{!save-changes.md!}

{end_tabs}
