# Supported browsers

In addition to the [mobile and desktop apps](https://zulip.com/apps/),
Zulip works great in all major modern web browsers. We recommend
pinning the Zulip tab in your favorite browser, so that it's always
easy to find.

For the best user experience, the latest stable versions of the
browsers below are recommended.

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/)
* [Edge](https://microsoft.com/en-us/edge/)
* [Safari](https://apple.com/safari/)

## Cross-protocol apps

Zulip is supported by most multi-protocol desktop chat apps like
[Rambox](https://rambox.pro) and [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org/).

We recommend choosing a product in this space that regularly releases
security updates; several popular cross-protocol Electron apps have
gone defunct over the years. Using a poorly maintained Electron app is
a major security risk similar to using an old version of Chrome with
dozens of published security vulnerabilities.
