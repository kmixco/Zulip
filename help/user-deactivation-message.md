# User deactivation message

{!admin-only.md!}

When deactivating a user, it can be helpful to include a ban reason, to let other admins know why
this user will be banned. This option allows the admin to include this comment, which will be
available to the other admins, who may alter it if a more accurate reason should be presented.  

There are several "pre-made" options available, however a custom message can also be written.
