# Share and upload files

Zulip supports attaching files to messages, including images, documents, sound,
and video.

## Uploading a file

{!uploading-a-file.md!}

Zulip will automatically generate a **thumbnail** of the file when you send
it, if it can. You can
[preview the message](/help/preview-your-message-before-sending) before
sending to see what the thumbnail will look like.

## Troubleshooting info

Zulip does not generate thumbnails for messages with more than ten
attachments.

The maximum file size for attachments is 25MB in most Zulip installations.
This limit can be changed by the server administrator.
