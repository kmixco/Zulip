1. Collect your ClickUp **Team ID** by going to your ClickUp home view.
    The URL should look like `https://app.clickup.com/<TEAM_ID>/home`.
    Note down the `<TEAM_ID>`.

1. Collect your ClickUp **Client ID** and **Client Secret** :

    - Go to <https://app.clickup.com/settings/team/clickup-api> and click **Create an App**.

    - You will be prompted for **Redirect URL(s)**, enter the URL for your Zulip organization.
        e.g., `{{ zulip_url }}`.

    - Finally, note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

1. Download [zulip-clickup.py][2]. `Ctrl+s` or `Cmd+s` on that page should
   work in most browsers.

1. Make sure you have a working copy of [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/),
    it will be needed to run the script.

1. Run the `zulip-clickup.py` script in a terminal, after replacing the all caps
   arguments with the values collected above.

    ```
    python zulip-clickup.py --clickup-team-id TEAM_ID \
                            --clickup-client-id CLIENT_ID \
                            --clickup-client-secret CLIENT_SECRET
    ```

1. Follow the instructions in the terminal and keep an eye on your browser as you
    will be redirected to a ClickUp authorization page.
