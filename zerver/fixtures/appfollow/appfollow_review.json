Try slack for your team. About 3 years ago I became the tech lead for a small technology team for a BIG well known company. I was tired of clunky email and terrible corporate IM. Trying slack in the short term was great, my entire team was using it within days to bypass email and communicate effortlessly throughout the day. Then something amazing happened. We figured out how to get our computer systems we managed to send automated messages to a channel in slack. This feature alone saved us from implementing a clunky \"monitoring\" system. Our product literally talked to us when it felt bad, hard disks full etc, so we could intervene before things got really bad via notifications to my iPhone and saved my skin a few times. Other than that the app is thoroughly thought out and should be considered a template on how to develop next level cross platform applications.","country":"gb","lang":null,"app_version":"3.9","created":"2016-11-26 21:08:31","user_id":"49221021","rating":"5","author":"Perkimon","title":"Slack is awesome.","date":"2016-11-26","review_id":"1490632060"},{"app_version":"3.9","lang":null,"country":"us","content":"I work remote often, and the mobile app keeps me connected to my team.

Honestly, I probably wouldn't have given a review, but seeing your comments never fail to give me a smile prompted me to do so. The app is professionally done and mainly aesthetically pleasing.
