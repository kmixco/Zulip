## Response

#### Return values

* `authentication_methods`: object in which each key-value pair in the object
  indicates whether the authentication method is enabled on this server.
* `zulip_version`: the version of Zulip running in the server.
* `zulip_feature_level`: an integer indicating what features are
    available on the server. The feature level increases monotonically;
    a value of N means the server supports all API features introduced
    before feature level N.  This is designed to provide a simple way
    for client apps to decide whether the server supports a given
    feature or API change.  See the [changelog](/api/changelog) for
    details on what each feature level means.

    **Changes**.  New in Zulip 2.2.  We recommend using an implied value
    of 0 for Zulip servers that do not send this field.

* `push_notifications_enabled`: whether mobile/push notifications are enabled.
* `is_incompatible`: whether the Zulip client that has sent a request to
  this endpoint is deemed incompatible with the server.
* `email_auth_enabled`: setting for allowing users authenticate with an
  email-password combination.
* `require_email_format_usernames`: whether usernames should have an
  email address format. This is important for clients to know whether
  the validate email address format in a login prompt; this value will
  be false if the server has
  [LDAP authentication][ldap-auth]
  enabled with a username and password combination.
* `realm_uri`: the organization's canonical URI.
* `realm_name`: the organization's name (for display purposes).
* `realm_icon`: the URI of the organization's logo as a square image,
  used for identifying the organization in small locations in the
  mobile and desktop apps.
* `realm_description`: HTML description of the organization, as configured by
  the [organization profile](/help/create-your-organization-profile).
* `external_authentication_methods`: list of dictionaries describing
  the available external authentication methods (such as
  google/github/SAML) enabled for this organization. Each dictionary
  specifies the name and icon that should be displayed on the login
  buttons (`display_name` and `display_icon`, where `display_icon` can
  be `null`, if no icon is to be displayed), the URLs that
  should be accessed to initiate login/signup using the method
  (`login_url` and `signup_url`) and `name`, which is a unique,
  stable, machine-readable name for the authentication method.  The
  list is sorted in the order in which these authentication methods
  should be displayed.

Please note that not all of these attributes are guaranteed to appear in a
response, for two reasons:

* This endpoint has evolved over time, so responses from older Zulip servers
  might be missing some keys (in which case a client should assume the
  appropriate default).
* If a `/server_settings` request is made to the root domain of a
  multi-subdomain server, like the root domain of zulipchat.com, the settings
  that are realm-specific are not known and thus not provided.

#### Example response

A typical successful JSON response for a single-organization server may look like:

{generate_code_example|/server_settings:get|fixture(200)}
