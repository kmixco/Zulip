# PMs, mentions, and alerts

You can configure desktop, mobile, and email notifications for
[private messages](/help/private-messages), [mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group), and
[alert words](/help/add-an-alert-word).

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Toggle the notification settings under **Private messages, @-mentions, and alert words**.

{end_tabs}

These settings will affect notifications for private messages, group
private messages, mentions, and alert words.

You can also hide the content of private messages (and group private
messages) from desktop notifications.
Under **Other notification settings**, uncheck
**Include content of private messages in desktop notifications**.

## Wildcard mentions

By default, wildcard mentions (`@**all**`, `@**everyone**`) trigger
email/push notifications as though they were personal @-mentions.  You
can toggle whether you receive notifications for wildcard mentions:

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Stream messages**, toggle **Notifications for @all/@everyone mentions**.

{end_tabs}
