# Show only messages in a particular topic

Click on the topic, on a message containing it in the message table. You can do
the same thing by clicking on a stream in the left sidebar to open a list of
recent topics, and then click on a topic there. Only the most topics are listed,
though; if you want to find an older topic, you may have to use the search box
(above the message table) or scroll back in time by hand.
