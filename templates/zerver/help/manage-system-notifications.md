# Manage System Notifications

Zulip is able to send you notifications when you are away from Zulip in
various ways. It can send desktop notifications when Zulip is merely out of
focus, email digests when you are offline, and mobile notifications according
to your preferences. In order to manage how Zulip contacts you, go to
[notification settings](/#settings/notifications) and select the notification
options that you want.

## Stream Settings

By default, Zulip does not send notifications for your subscribed streams. If
you want to change that default and get notifications for your subscribed
streams, go to the [system notification settings](/#settings/notifications)
and select one or several of the options, including **Visual Desktop Notifications**,
**Audible Desktop Notifications**, and/or **Mobile Notifications**. You
can then choose to apply the notification settings on each of your
subscribed streams, or only to future subscriptions. If you want to adjust 
the notification settings on individual streams to be different from the 
system setting that you set in system
notifications, you can adjust the [settings on individual streams](/#streams)
after you set the default.

     **Note:** If you change the default after adjusting
	the notification settings on individual streams, the system setting will override the
	previous individual setting.

## Private Messages and @-Mentions

By default, Zulip will send visual and audible desktop notifications for
private messages and @-mentions, as well as email and mobile notifications for
private messages and @-mentions when you are offline. You have the option of
including or excluding the content of private messages from your desktop
notifications. You also have the option of activating mobile notifications
even when you are online.

## Other notification settings

--Can we rename "Other notification settings" to "Digest Email Settings"

--What actually goes into email digests?

--Can we move "Include content of private messages" to the emails
--notifications in the "private messages" section

Finally, you can choose to include the organization name in your digest
emails. This is especially useful if you are active in multiple Zulip realms.
