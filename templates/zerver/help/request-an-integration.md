# Request an integration

Zulip provides its user over 100 native integrations. Several hundred more are
available through [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/home),
and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) but there can be times where you donâ€™t find an integration
or bot you need.

In such cases, you can request the integration by filing a feature request on our
GitHub issues page. While filing a feature request please provide as much detail
and context as possible.
