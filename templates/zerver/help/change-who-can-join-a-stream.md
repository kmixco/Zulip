# Change who can join a stream
Zulip supports the use of private streams to change who can join a stream. You can create new private streams as a user with stream creation privileges
or make an existing stream private as an administrator.
To do so, start by navigating to the **subscriptions page**.

### Finding the subscriptions page
There are multiple ways to navigate to the subscriptions page. You can either:

1. Click the **cog** (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) icon in the top right corner.
2. Select the **Manage Streams** option from the dropdown menu.

### Make an existing stream private
To make an existing stream private you must be an administrator. Once you are on the **subscriptions page**:

1. Select the stream you want to edit by either searching for its name or finding it in the streams list.
2. Under the **Stream Settings**, find the "**Administrator settings**" section.
3. Finally click the "**Make stream private**" button.

### Make a new private stream
Zulip allows users with stream creation privileges to create their own private streams. Once you are on the **subscriptions page**:

1. Click the "+" sign to create a new stream.
2. Enter a stream name and add a stream description of your choice (a description is optional).
3. Under **Stream accessibility**, click the "**People must be invited**" option.
4. Finally, invite any users you wish to add and click the **Create** button in the bottom right corner of the modal.
