Links in messages are expanded to an inline preview in Zulip, letting you and
others conveniently see more information about the link being shared.

Adding a URL to your message creates a preview showing a title, description, and
thumbnail image if they are available.

Up to 5 links can be expanded to an inline preview in a message.
