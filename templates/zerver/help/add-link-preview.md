# Add a link preview

!!! warn ""

    Note: This feature is off by default for website links but [can be
    enabled by organization administrators.](/help/allow-image-link-previews)

Links in messages are expanded to an inline preview in Zulip, letting you and
others conveniently see more information about the link being shared.

Adding a URL to your message creates a preview showing a title, description, and
thumbnail image if they are available.

![Example message with inline preview](/static/images/help/link-preview.png)

Up to 5 links can be expanded to an inline preview in a message.
