# Join a Zulip organization

By default, Zulip organizations require an invitation to join.

Organization administrators can allow anyone to join without an invitation, or
restrict user email addresses to a company domain.

## See if you need an invitation to join

1. Go to the Zulip URL of the organization.

1. Click Sign up.

1. If you see a sign up form, invitations are not required! Otherwise, the
page will say that you need an invitation to join.

## See if you need an email from a specific domain

1. Go to the Zulip URL of the organization.

1. Click **Sign up**.

1. Under **Email** enter your email address.

1. Click **Sign up**. If your email is from an acceptable domain, you will be
sent a confirmation email. If your email address's domain is not in the
organization's list of accepted email domains, you will get a message
informing you of that fact.

## Accept an invitation

Invitations to Zulip organizations come by email. Look for an email from
Zulip. It may take a few minutes for the invitation email to reach your
inbox.

!!! tip ""
    This page only applies to organizations that don't have single sign-on
    authentication (SSO). If you are not at a large organization, your Zulip
    likely does not have SSO. If your organization has SSO, you will be
    automatically logged in whenver you visit Zulip.

!!! tip ""
    If you are a part of multiple Zulip organizations, we
    recommend using the Zulip Desktop app because the desktop app makes it easy
    to switch between different organizations.
