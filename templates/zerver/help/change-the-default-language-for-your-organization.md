# Change the default language

{!admin-only.md!}

Zulip has been translated or partially translated into a number of different
languages. You can see which languages Zulip supports, and help add support
for new languages on **[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/zulip/zulip/)**.

Individual users can change the language Zulip uses for their own personal use
by [changing their individual setting](change-your-language). However, if your
organization usually uses a language other than English, you can set the default
language for new users.
