# Set default streams for new users

{!admin-only.md!}

When new users join a Zulip organization, they are subscribed to a default set
of streams. Organization administrators can control which streams are in that
default set of streams.

## Add a new default stream

{settings_tab|default-streams-list}

2. Enter the name of the stream in the box next to **Stream name**.

3. Click **Add stream**.

## Remove a default stream

{settings_tab|default-streams-list}

2. Find the stream name that you would like to remove from the default set of
streams and click **Remove from default** to the right.
