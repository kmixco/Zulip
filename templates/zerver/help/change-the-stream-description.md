# Change the stream description

Note: Only administrators can change a stream's description.

To change a stream's description, you'll first need to access
your current stream subscriptions.
You can do this by clicking on the settings cog at the top of
your streams list on the left.

(You can also access current stream subscriptions by clicking on
**Manage Streams** from the settings cog (![](/static/images/help/cog.png))
in the top right.)

A window with your current stream subscriptions will appear.
From the left, select the stream whose description you'd like
to change.

Under **Administrator settings** on the right, there is a field
with the current stream description.
Change your stream's description in this field, and click
**Change stream description** to save the change.
