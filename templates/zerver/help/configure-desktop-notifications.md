# Configure desktop notifications

You can receive desktop notifications for messages sent while Zulip is
offscreen.

## All streams

You can receive notifications for normal stream messages. These instructions
tell you how to set your preference for all subscribed stream messages at
once. You can also set
[notification preferences for individual streams](/help/set-notifications-for-a-single-stream).

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Stream Messages**, select **Visual desktop notifications** and/or
**Audible desktop notifications**.

1. Under "Apply this change to all current stream subscriptions?", select
"yes" to start recieving desktop notifications for streams that you are
currently subscribed to. Note that the change will apply even if you
previously set a notification preference on an individual stream. Select "no"
if you only want to apply your setting to streams that you subscribe to in
the future.

@-mentions.
