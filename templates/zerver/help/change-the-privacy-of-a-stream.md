# Change the privacy of a stream

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, a stream's privacy level is set at creation time by the
stream creator.

An organization administrator can also change the privacy level of a stream
under certain conditions. The organization administrator can always make a
public stream private. However, the organization administrator must be a
subscriber to a private stream in order to take that private stream public or
convert it into a different type of private stream. If a private stream needs
a different privacy level, it needs to have an organization administrator
subscribed.

Any users that were subscribed to the stream will remain subscribed to the
stream after someone changes the stream's privacy.
