# Change a user's name
An administrator can change the name of another user.
Ordinary users can change their own names,
so administrators should generally try to teach users how to do this for themselves,
but administrators can do it when users are unavailable.

Follow the following steps to change the name of a user using an administrator account:
* Click on the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) icon in the upper right corner
of the right sidebar.

* Choose **Administration** in the panel below:

![admin-panel](/static/images/help/admin.png)

* The following window will appear:
![admin-window](/static/images/help/admin-window.png)

* Click on the tab named **Users** and you will find a window like the below one:
![user-name-window](/static/images/help/user-name-window.png)

* Click on the pencil (![pencil](/static/images/help/pencil.png)) icon next to the name of the user
you want to change.

* You can edit the user's name as shown below:

* After editing the name of the user, you can save the changes by clicking on the **Save changes** button.
