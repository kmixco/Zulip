# Test mobile notifications

Normally, mobile notifications are only sent if you're idle, which isn't
ideal for testing.

You can instead have mobile notifications sent for all [private messages](/help/private-messages),
regardless of whether you're online.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Private messages and @-mentions**, enable
   **Mobile notifications**.

1. Under **Private messages, @-mentions, and alert words**, enable
   **Send mobile notifications even if I'm online**.
