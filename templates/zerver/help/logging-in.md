# Logging in

Zulip allows logging in using an email/password pair, your Google account, or
your GitHub account. Organization administrators can add other authentication
methods, including SSO or LDAP integration, or disable any of the methods
above.

To log in, go to your organization's Zulip URL and follow the on-screen instructions.

!!! tip ""
    You can log in with any method, regardless of how you signed up. E.g. if
    you originally signed up using your Google account, you can later log in
    using GitHub, as long as your Google account and GitHub account use the
    same email address.

## Troubleshooting

### I don't know my Zulip URL

 * Ask your organization administrator for your Zulip URL.

 * Search your email for your invitation or confirmation email.

 * Guess common URL patterns, like example.zulipchat.com, zulip.example.com, or
chat.example.com.

 * If you know your organization is hosted on zulipchat.com, go to
[find my account](https://zulipchat.com/accounts/find/) and enter
the email address that you signed up with.
