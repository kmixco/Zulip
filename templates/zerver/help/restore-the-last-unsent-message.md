# Restore the last unsent message

If you accidentally delete your message by clicking the **x**
(<i class="icon-vector-remove"></i>) icon in the upper right corner of
your messaging box or by clicking outside the **Compose Message** box, you can
restore the draft of your previous unsent message.

To restore, simply click a blue link labeled **Restore draft**, which appears between
the A (<i class="icon-vector-font"></i>) and eye
(<i class="icon-vector-eye-open"></i>) icons.
