# Send someone a private message

Instead of sending a new private message through the compose box, you can
send a private message to someone through the user list on the right
sidebar.

1. In the user list on the right sidebar, hover over the name of the user
you want to privately message to reveal a down chevron (<i
class="icon-vector-chevron-down"></i>) icon to the right of the user's name.

    !!! tip ""
        You can search for a specific user by entering the user's name in
        the **Search users** input.

2. Click on the {!down-chevron.md!} Select the
**Compose a message to (user's name)** option from the actions dropdown.

3. Upon selecting the **Compose a message to (user's name)** option, the
compose box will be transformed to include the selected user's email address
in the **one or more people...** field.

4. Enter your message in the **Compose your message here...** field.

5. Once you have completed your message, you can now send your message
to the specified user by pressing the Enter key or clicking the **Send**
button, depending on your settings.

!!! tip ""
    You can always delete your message by clicking the x (<i
    class="icon-vector-remove"></i>) icon located at the top-right corner of
    your compose box.

        You can search for a specific user by entering the user's name in
        the **Search users** input.

2. Upon clicking on the user's name, your view will be narrowed to your
private message history with the selected user, and the compose box will be
transformed to include the selected user's email address in the
**one or more people...** field.
