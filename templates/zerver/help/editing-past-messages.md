### Editing past messages

 * If you want to edit a past message of your own after it has been
   posted, hover your mouse over the message. You should see a
   little pencil ![pencil](/static/images/help/pencil.png) at the end
   of the message and a “down-chevron”
   ![down chevron](/static/images/help/down_chevron.png) near the
   upper right corner of the message. Clicking either one of these
   will give you editing options.
   
 * It is possible that your chat is configured to set a limit on the time you may
   edit a message, e.g. 10 minutes. As soon as that limit has passed, the little pencil
   ![pencil](/static/images/help/pencil.png)  changes to a file icon 
   <img src="/static/images/help/file.png" width = "18">. Depending on the configuration, clicking on it might allow you
   to change the topic, 
   like shown in this message 
   
   <img src="/static/images/help/message_time_limit_passed.png" width="480">

 * You cannot entirely delete a message. When you remove all the text of a message and save it,
   Zulip will automatically insert a "(deleted)" into your message. 
   The fact that there was once a message there will still be
   evident, and the time stamp of the original posting date and time
   will still be shown.

 * After you have edited a message, `(EDITED)` appears over the
   message and to the right of your name. It is visible to everyone.

 * Editing topic titles is discussed in a separate answer,
   **[Edit topic](index.md#editing-a-topic-title)**.
