# Disable weekly digest emails

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, Zulip sends weekly emails to users who haven't been active
for 5 or more days to regain their interest. These emails include new
streams created and stream traffic (of subscribed streams) that can intrigue users.

To understand the structure and content type of the digest emails, see a
[sample digest email](/digest).
