4. Confirm the deletion of your account by clicking **Deactivate now**.

## What happens when you deactive an account

 * Any bots that you maintain will be disabled.

 * Deactivating your account won't delete messages or files you've shared. If
   permitted, delete content you'd like to remove before deactivating your
   account.

 * You cannot register a Zulip account using the email
    address of a deactivated account. If you change your mind about deactivating an account,
    you ask your Zulip organization administrator to
    [reactivate](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user#reactivate-a-user)
    your account.

!!! warn ""
    If you're the only administrator in the organization, you cannot
    deactivate your account; you need to make another user an administrator first
    before you can deactivate your account.
