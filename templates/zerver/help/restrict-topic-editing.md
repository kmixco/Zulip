# Restrict topic editing

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, anyone can edit any message topic. This is useful because it
allows the community to keep conversations organized and on-topic, even if
some members of the community are still learning how to use topics
effectively.

Organization administrators can turn off community topic editing. Users will
still be able to edit the topics of their own messages for as long as they can
[edit their own messages](/help/edit-or-delete-a-message).

{settings_tab|organization-settings}

2. Under **Message editing**, deselect **Users can edit the topic of any message**.

{!save-changes.md!}

!!! tip ""
    Users can always edit the topic of messages with **(no topic)**, even if topic
    editing is otherwise turned off. Organization administrators can avoid that
    situation by [requiring topics](/help/require-topics)
