# Rename a Stream

**Note:** This feature is only available to administrators.

If you would like to change the name of an existing stream, locate the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) next to **Streams** in your left sidebar. A tooltip labeled **Subscribe, add, or configure streams** will appear.

After clicking the cog, a modal with an overview of all existing streams will pop up.

To change the name of a stream, first click on the stream you want to change. After selecting a stream, a list of settings should appear in the right-hand panel under **Stream Settings.** Scroll down to **Administrator settings** to see the option to change the stream's name.

Once the **Rename stream** field is selected, type in the new stream name. Your new stream name must be unique and no longer than 60 characters.
If your stream name is valid, clicking the **Rename stream** button will save your changes.
