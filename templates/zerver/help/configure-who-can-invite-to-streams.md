# Restrict stream invitation

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, anyone other than guests can invite others to streams. However, you can restrict stream
invitation to:

* **Organization administrators**
* **Organization administrators and all members**
* **Organization administrators and [full members](/help/restrict-permissions-of-new-members)**

For corporations and other entities with controlled access, we highly
recommend keeping stream invitation open. For entities with lots of streams with confidential
contents, it may be desirable to limit invitations.

### Manage who can create streams

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

2. Under **Other permissions**, configure **Who can invite other users to streams**.

{end_tabs}
