## View the markdown source of a message

If one of your peers sends a message, you can view the markdown of the
message to learn more about formatting tricks or to reuse their markdown
in a reply.

To view the markdown source of an message, simply hover your mouse over
the message and press the down chevron button near the upper right corner.

Next, press on the View Source button and you should see this screen pop up,
showing you the markdown source.

old to edit.
