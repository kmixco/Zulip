# Change the date and time format
By default, messages in Zulip are displayed with a 12-hour timestamp. If you are used to seeing time displayed in a 24-hour format, you can change the Zulip timestamp format from a 12-hour format to a 24-hour format.

Change the date and time format by:

1. Click the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of the right sidebar.
2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu that appears.
3. Scroll down to the **Display Settings** section
4. Select the option labeled **Display time in 24-hour format (17:00 instead of 5:00 PM)**, then reload the page in order for the change to take effect.

**[Go to "Table of contents"](/help/#using-zulip)**
