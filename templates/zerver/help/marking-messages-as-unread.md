# Marking messages as unread

Zulip lets you manually mark messages as unread, which makes it easy to return
to a conversation later.

Specifically, Zulip offers a **Mark as unread from here** option, which lets you
mark the selected message and all newer messages in your current view as unread.

## Mark as unread from selected message
