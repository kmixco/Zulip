# Marking messages as unread

Zulip offers tools to manually mark a series of messages as unread. If you want
to remember to read a conversation later, you can mark the messages in that
conversation as unread. When messages get marked as unread, a line will appear
along the left side of those messages, and your name will be removed from the
list of read receipts.

## Mark as unread from selected message

Selecting this option on a message tells Zulip that you want the messages in
that conversation to be added to your queue of unread messages.
