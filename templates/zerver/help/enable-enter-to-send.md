# Enable `Enter` to send

By default, the `Enter` key adds a new line to a message,
and `Ctrl` + `Enter` sends the message.

This is convenient for typing multi-line messages, which are more common in
Zulip than in most other chat products. However, you can also configure
Zulip so that `Enter` sends the message.
