# Mention a Team Member

![@-mention a team member](/static/images/help/mention_user.png)

When having a conversation in Zulip, you may sometimes need to call
the attention of another member. You can alert other
users within a particular stream through using **@mention** in
the **Compose Message** box. Type `@` followed by their email address or one of
their names (first name or surname), and
Zulip will offer you tab-completions. A completed `@mention` will look
something like: `@**name**`, where **name** is the user you want to alert, and it
will appear as @\*\*name\*\* in the Markdown source of your message.

    **Note:** You cannot mention users while editing messages because the user you
    want to mention may have already read the original message and the method to
    notify them is not clear.

If you attempt to `@mention` someone who is not subscribed to the
current stream, Zulip will ask if you would like to subscribe them to
the stream:

!!! tip ""
    You can view any mentions calling your attention by clicking on the
    "@-mentions" view in the left sidebar.
