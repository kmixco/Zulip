# @-mention a user

You can @-mention a team member to call their attention to a
message. @-mentions follow the same
[notification settings](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications) as private
messages and alert words.

Note that an @-mention inside quoted text will not mention the user. So feel
free to quote and reply without worrying about spurious mentions.

## From the compose box
