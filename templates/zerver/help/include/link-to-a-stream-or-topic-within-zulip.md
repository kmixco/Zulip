Zulip automatically creates links to streams and topics in messages you send.

The easiest way to link to a stream or topic is:

{start_tabs}

1. Type `#` followed by the one or more letters of the stream name.

2. Choose the desired stream from the auto-complete menu. The link will be
   automatically formatted for you.

3. If linking to a topic, type `>` after selecting a stream as described above,
   followed by one or more letters of the topic name.

4. Choose the desired topic from the auto-complete menu. The link will be
   automatically formatted for you.

{end_tabs}

Alternatively, it is possible to manually format stream and topic links:

<pre>Stream: #<i>stream name</i>
Topic: #<i>topic name</i></pre>
