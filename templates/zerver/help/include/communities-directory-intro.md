    Still in development; to be launched in summer 2022.

The Zulip [communities directory](/help/communities-directory) is used
to promote and highlight organizations on [Zulip Cloud][zulip-cloud]
that are open to the public. To be considered eligible for the
communities directory, an organization must have at least one [public
access option](/help/public-access-option) or allow users to [join
without an invitation][join-without-invite].

Organization administrators can [give permission][communities-directory-permission]
to be advertised in the directory, though this does not guarantee
being listed.

[join-without-invite]: /help/restrict-account-creation#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join
[communities-directory-permission]: /help/communities-directory#give-permission-to-be-in-the-zulip-communities-directory
