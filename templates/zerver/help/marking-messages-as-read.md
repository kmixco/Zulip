# Marking messages as read

## Move the blue box to mark messages as read
In the Zulip desktop or web app, messages are marked as read when the
**blue box** passes over them. You can move the blue box with the keyboard (see
[keyboard shortcuts for navigation](/help/keyboard-shortcuts#navigation)),
or by scrolling the message feed with your mouse.

## Scroll to mark messages as read

Zulip automatically keeps track of which messages you have and haven't read.
Unread messages have a dark line along their left side, which fades as
the message gets marked as read. When you get to the bottom of a view, Zulip
marks all messages in that view as read.

## Mark all messages as read

You can manually **mark all messages as read**, or **mark all messages in a
stream or topic as read**.
