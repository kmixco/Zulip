## Move the blue box to mark messages as read
In the Zulip desktop or web app, messages are marked as read when the
**blue box** passes over them. You can move the blue box with the keyboard (see
[keyboard shortcuts for navigation](/help/keyboard-shortcuts#navigation)),
or by scrolling the message feed with your mouse.

## Scroll to mark messages as read

Zulip automatically keeps track of which messages you have and haven't read.
Unread messages have a dark line along their left side, which fades as
the message gets marked as read. When you get to the bottom of a view, Zulip
marks all messages in that view as read.

## Mark all messages as read

You can manually **mark all messages as read**, or **mark all messages in a
stream or topic as read**.

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

1. Hover over a stream, topic, or **All messages** in the left sidebar.

1. Click the ellipsis (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-ellipsis-v-solid"></i>)
   to the right.

1. Click **Mark all messages as read**.

{tab|mobile}

   (<img src="/static/images/help/mobile-globe-icon.svg" alt="globe" class="mobile-icon"/>)
