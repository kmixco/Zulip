# The Zulip browser window

There are three panes in your browser window.

 * The middle one, the “**message table**”, is the stream of messages.

 * To its left is the “**left sidebar**”, showing “filters” or “views”
   for different kinds of messages, and below it a menu of streams you
   are subscribed to.

 * On the right side of the browser window is the “**right sidebar**”,
   showing users and some configuration settings:

   ![Left sidebar](/static/images/help/left_sidebar.png)
   ![Right sidebar](/static/images/help/right_sidebar.png)

 * If your browser window is narrow, you’ll see only the message
   table, or the message table and the left sidebar but not the right
   sidebar.
