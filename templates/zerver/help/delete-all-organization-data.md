# Delete your organization's data

Upon request by all owners of an organization hosted on Zulip Cloud,
we can delete all organization data, including user accounts and information
as well as messages. Please note that we have to preserve:

* Old logs related to the organization
* Billing history (if any)
* The support ticket for handling your deletion request and related internal communications

If you'd like us to delete your organization's data, contact [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com).
