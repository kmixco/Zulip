# Zulip User Documentation (draft)

**Caveat**: This file is intended to collect all proposed user
documentation into one place. Ultimately, a single file is probably
not the best format for documentation when it is published to the
world, but for purposes of discussion it seems easiest to put
everything into a solitary and linear page.

Zulip is a chat app. Its most distinctive characteristic is that
conversation among a group of people can be divided according to
subject “**streams**” and further subdivided into “**topics**”, so
much finer-grained conversations are possible than with IRC or other
chat tools.

Most people use Zulip on the Web. There are also mobile apps for
Android/iOS, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows, as well as a
cross-platform version and a version for Platform 9. See
[the documentation on apps](/apps) for more information.

One Zulip account, associated with a particular organization, is known
as a “**realm**”.

## The Zulip browser window

 * There are three panes in your browser window.

   The middle one, the “**message table**”, is the stream of messages.

   To its left is the “**left sidebar**”, showing “filters” or “views”
   for different kinds of messages, and below it a menu of streams you
   are subscribed to:

   ![Left sidebar](/static/images/help/left_sidebar.png)

   On the right side of the browser window is the “**right sidebar**”,
   showing users and some configuration settings:

   ![Right sidebar](/static/images/help/right_sidebar.png)

 * If your browser window is narrow, you’ll see only the message
   table, or the message table and the left sidebar but not the right
   sidebar.

## Posting and replying

**[… To a stream](#posting-and-replying-to-a-stream)** |
**[… To individual users](#posting-and-replying-to-individual-users)** |
**[Some facts about messages](#some-facts-about-messages)** |
**[Editing past messages](editing-past-messages.md)**

At the bottom of your screen, choose whether to post to a stream or to
individual users. ![New message](/static/images/help/new_message.png)

### Posting and replying to a stream

 1. If you click on a message, the default action is to open a
    text-box for you to enter a new message.

 1. If you would rather post something new, click “New stream message”
    at the bottom of your screen (or select a stream from the list on
    the left side of your
    screen). ![Post to stream](/static/images/help/post_to_stream.png)

 1. Enter a stream name, or the beginning of one. Private
    (“invite-only”) streams show a lock next to the name.

 1. Enter a topic name — we recommend keeping them brief, and they are
    truncated after 50 characters.

 1. Enter your message.

  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Posting and replying to individual users (“PM”: private message)
    ![Post to user](/static/images/help/post_to_user.png)

 * Enter the name or email address of a user, or the first letters of
   one. There is no topic when you PM someone.

 * You can send a message to multiple users at once, by separating
   their email addresses with a comma. Each recipient will see all the
   other recipients. For several days, the list of recipients will
   appear under “GROUP PMs” at the lower right corner of your screen.

 * If you’re bashful about using the pronoun “I”, you can get your own
   registered name to appear boldfaced in a message by entering
   `/me`. At present it has to be the first thing on a line, and
   followed by at least one non-space character. Some people find it
   easier to say things like `/me is puzzled` or `/me nods` than to
   use a massively freighted word like “I”.

### Some facts about messages

 * The paperclip icon
   (![paperclip](/static/images/help/paperclip.png)) under the message
   field lets you attach files, including images, sound, and
   video. These are uploaded to a server and a link is supplied, but
   we display a thumbnail if we can. You’ll see the link in Markdown
   format: `[link_text](link_URL)`

 * Zulip uses a subset of
   [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables)
   (GFM), and the **A** icon under the message field brings up a
   cheat-sheet for what we support. You can also see that cheat-sheat
   by going to the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the
   upper right corner of the right sidebar and choosing “Message
   formatting” from the drop-down menu.

 * If a message is interrupted before you send it, the next time you
   open the “New stream message” interface you’ll see “Restore draft”
   below the message field. Currently we only save a single
   interrupted message, and if you log out of the Zulip site or close
   the tab, the message will be deleted.

 * Type a tab and then the “return” key to click the Send button
   without having to use your mouse.

 * Typing “return” will begin a new paragraph within your message; if
   you want typing “return” simply to send your message, check the
   “Press Enter to send” box under the message field. It stays checked
   until you uncheck it.

 * If you want greater separation of your paragraphs, enter a
   non-breaking space (option-space on Macintosh) on a line alone
   between other paragraphs.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Go to the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right
corner of the right sidebar and choose “Keyboard shortcuts” from the
drop-down menu.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Searching

Zulip searches incrementally (and case-independent) as you type, but
will only match your typing at the beginning of a stream name. So
typing _el_ won’t bring up “Help”, but _he_ will.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Searching for past messages

It is possible to do limited searches on past messages. Some special
features and limitations:

 * If there are many hits, only the most recent ones are returned.

 * Searching by date isn’t currently possible.

 * Search hits include morphological variants by default (if you
   search for _walking_ you’ll also get _walk_, _walks_, _walked_, and
   so on). Sometimes putting a search term in quotes seems to
   eliminate the variants, but that behavior isn’t consistent right
   now.

 * It’s possible to combine search terms within parentheses using
   logical operators — searching for `(“arrays” and “queues”)` will
   return only those messages containing both _arrays_ and _queues_.

 * Many common words are “stop words” — the search tool will ignore
   them, because they appear in too many messages to be useful.

 * To see a list of search operators, go to the cog
   (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of
   the right sidebar and choose “Search help” from the drop-down menu.

  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Find starred messages

If you have starred a message and sometime later want to find it
again, you can bring up all the message you have starred by clicking
the "Starred messages" view (in the filters at the top of the left
sidebar).

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Show only particular messages

 * Show only messages in a particular stream

   This is called “narrowing” to a stream. The simplest way is by
   clicking on the stream’s name in the left sidebar.

 * Show only messages in a particular topic

   Click on the topic, on a message containing it in the message
   table. You can do the same thing by clicking on a stream in the
   left sidebar to open a list of recent topics, and then click on a
   topic there. Only the most topics are listed, though; if you want
   to find an older topic, you may have to use the search box (above
   the message table) or scroll back in time by hand.

 * Show only messages with a particular user

   Click on the user’s name in the right sidebar and your PM history
   will appear. If you have had group-PM conversations, they will only
   show up if you “narrow to” private messages with all participants —
   narrowing to just one user will not show group PMs including that
   user.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Date of a message

If you “mouse over” the time stamp of a message (upper right corner of
the message), you’ll see a fuller date-time stamp and time zone.

  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Changing the title of a topic or stream

If discussion drifts, at what point should the title of a topic or
stream be changed?

In the end, this is a question of community culture within your
organization. But here are some thoughts:

 * **Topics**: Topics drift more often than streams. Some people like
   to announce that they are “moving” or “forking” the topic and then
   creating a new topic with its own title — the new title could, if
   you wish, say “was ‘former topic’” or “forked from ‘previous
   topic’”. Also, please see
   **[Editing a topic titles](#editing-a-topic-title)**, below.

 * **Streams**: If a stream has to be divided, it is best to retire
   the original stream complete, otherwise the separated-out subject
   may periodically reappear in the original stream. This is is an
   issue for administrators to watch for.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Editing a topic title

As long you have contributed a message to some topic, you can edit the
topic title. Go to one of your own messages in that topic and follow
**[the instructions for editing it](#editing-past-messages)**. Notice
that the topic title is now editable, too. You will be offered the
chance to change the topic in one of three ways:

 * Change only this message topic
 * Change later messages to this topic
 * Change previous and later messages to this topic

Your edits will be applied if you “save” the message, even if the body
of the message is unchanged.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Message formatting

Zulip uses a subset of
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables)
(GFM), To see the current subset, go to the cog
(![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of the
right sidebar and choose “Message formatting” from the drop-down menu.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### User status

… is marked by little circles to the left of a user’s name:

 * A green circle
   (![green circle](/static/images/help/green_circle.png)) means the
   user is “active” — the browser has determined that the Zulip page
   has “focus” at the moment on the user’s computer.

 * A white, circle
   (![white empty circle](/static/images/help/white_empty_circle.png))
   means the user is not active and was not recently so.

 * A orange half-filled circle
   (![orange half circle](/static/images/help/orange_half_circle.png))
   means the user is “not active” but was recently so.

 The same information is available by mousing over a given user’s name.

 If you have messaged multiple individual users, their names will
 appear at the bottom of the right sidebar. In that case, a pale green
 circle
 (![pale green circle](/static/images/help/pale_green_circle.png))
 means that some are recently but not currently active, while others
 are state unknown. A regular green circle
 (![green circle](/static/images/help/green_circle.png)) means they
 are all at least recently active.

### Interacting with Zulip by email

You can receive all activity from all streams, or just some streams,
or just messages in which you were mentioned, by playing with the
Settings — go to the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the
upper right corner of the right sidebar and choose “Settings”
there. You can also post to a stream by email — the Manage Streams
pane shows you the email address to use for any particular stream.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Emoji

 * **Adding emoji to a message**. There are two ways to do this:

   * Zulip fully supports Unicode, so if you find any emoji you like
     and paste them into your message (👛🚹🏪🎿), they will be
     accepted. You can browse the
     [Unicode Consortium's full list of emoji](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html),
     although our emoji images may differ from what you see there.

   * Zulip also lets you enter emoji by name, using the format
     `:name:`. So sending `:octopus: :film_projector:
     :revolving_hearts:` will produce
     ![octopus](/static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/octopus.png)
     ![film_projector](/static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/film_projector.png)
     ![revolving_hearts](/static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/revolving_hearts.png). You
     can find emoji that are accessible this way by typing a colon and
     two or more letters of the alphabet — a pop-up menu will appear
     showing the first five emoji-names containing the letters you
     typed (consecutively).

   In addition, an emoji pop-over menu is planned, to let you choose
   them by eye.

 * **What if I'd rather not see emoji in other people's
   messages?**. Sorry, this isn't yet supported.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Customization

 * **Zulip**. For customizing Zulip itself, there is a cog
   (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of
   the right sidebar, and it brings up a menu of options.

 * **Streams**. For customizing your stream subscriptions and
   individual streams, you can either use the “Manage Streams”
   menu-option under the main cog, or use the smaller cog above the
   list of streams in the left sidebar. The message table will be
   replaced with a “Streams” pane. (You can also get to this pane
   using the cog-icon above the list of streams in the left sidebar.)
   On the Streams pane you can create streams, subscribe or
   unsubscribe to existing streams, subscribe other people, mute or
   unmute a stream, and control a stream’s color and notification
   settings.

   For customizing an individual stream without opening the Streams
   pane, there is a “down-chevron”
   ![down chevron](/static/images/help/down_chevron.png) to the right
   of each stream-name in the left sidebar. Clicking the chevron opens
   a menu of options.

   Special things you can do with a stream you are subscribed to:

   * Turning off (“muting”) a stream, while staying subscribed to it.

   * “Pinning” a stream (moving it to the top of the list of streams).

   * Marking all messages as read.

   * Choosing a custom color.

   You can leave the Streams pane by clicking on Home near the top of
   the left sidebar.

 * **Other customizations** are available in the Settings pane. Please
   experiment with them.

**[Go back to “Other common questions”](#other-common-questions)** |
  **[Go back to “Table of contents”](#table-of-contents)**

### Muting a stream vs. unsubscribing from it

When a stream is muted you can still see (greyed out) how many unread
messages are there, and you can still read it and post to it while
it's muted — useful if you only want to read the stream on demand but
not have its messages populate your main Home message table.

And since subscribed-to streams are now sorted, with recently active
streams at the top of the list and inactive streams below, your
recently active but muted streams will be interlarded among your
unmuted streams, saving space.

You can't do any of that with a unsubscribed stream.
