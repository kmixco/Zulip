# Quote and reply

You can quote a previous message in your reply.

Note that an [@-mention](/help/at-mention-a-user) inside quoted text will
not mention the user, so feel free to quote and reply without worrying about
spurious mentions.

### Quote and reply

You can also use the keyboard shortcut `>` to quote the message under the
