# Allow anyone to join without an invitation

By default, new users can join a Zulip organization with or without an email
invitation.

However, if you are a realm administrator that wants to limit the membership of
your organization, you can choose to limit new members to those with email
invitations.

## Limiting new membership to users invited by organization members

1. Click the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner
of the right sidebar.

2. Select **Administration** from the dropdown menu that appears.

3. Upon clicking **Administration**, your view will be replaced with the
**Administration** page. You will be located on the **Organization settings**
tab by default.

4. In the **Organizations settings** section, locate the **E-mail invitation required**
checkbox.

    To limit new members of your organization to those who have been
    invited to do so, click the **E-mail invitation required** checkbox.

    New users will now require an email invitation sent by a user in your Zulip
organization to join your organization.

    * If you wish to further limit new membership to your organization, you can
    select the **Only admins may invite** option that appears when the
    **E-mail invitation required** option is selected.

        If this option is enabled, only administrators in your organization can
    send email invitations to new users.

5. To save any changes you have made to your organization settings, click the
blue **Save changes** button at the bottom of the **Organizations settings**
section.
