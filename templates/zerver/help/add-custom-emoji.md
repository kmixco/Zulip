5. In the green section labeled **Add a New Emoji**, find the **Emoji name** and

        Users will use the designated emoji phrase surrounded by colons to
        insert your emoji into their messages.

    * In the **Emoji URL** field, insert the link to your custom emoji's image. The
    link must start with **http://** or **https://**.
