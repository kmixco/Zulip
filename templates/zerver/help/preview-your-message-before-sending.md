# Previewing your message

You can preview your message before you send it by clicking the
**eye** (<i class="icon-vector-eye-open"></i>) icon.

This will bring up the message preview:

![Previewed](/static/images/help/during-preview.png)

To resume editing, click the **pencil and paper**
(<i class="icon-vector-edit"></i>) icon that
has replaced the **eye** (<i class="icon-vector-eye-open"></i>) icon.
