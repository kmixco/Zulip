# Link to a message or conversation

Zulip makes it easy to share links to messages, topics, and streams. You can
link from one Zulip conversation to another, or share links to Zulip conversations
in issue trackers, emails, or other external tools.

## Link to Zulip from anywhere

All URLs in Zulip are designed to be shareable.
Copying the URL from the browser's address bar will work
for all views, including searches.

### Get a link to a specific message

This copies to your clipboard a permanent link to the message,
displayed in its thread (i.e. topic view for messages in a stream).
Viewing a topic via a message link will never mark messages as read.

These links will still work even when the message is
[moved to another topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic)
or [stream](/help/move-content-to-another-stream) or
if its [topic is resolved](/help/resolve-a-topic).

Zulip uses the same permanent link syntax when [quoting a
message](/help/quote-and-reply).
