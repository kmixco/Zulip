# Change the topic of a message

By default, any user can change the topic of any message. This is useful for
keeping  messages organized even when some users are still learning how to use
topics effectively.

Organization administrators can [turn off community topic editing](/help/restrict-topic-editing).

1. Find a message with a topic that you wish to edit.

{!message-actions.md!} down chevron (<i class="icon-vector-chevron-down"></i>).

2. In field containing the existing topic, enter the new topic for your message.

3. By default, the topic change will apply only to the message you are
editing. However, you can select other options.

    * **Change only this message topic**

        This option only changes the topic of the message that you have
        selected. You may want to select this option if you sent the message
        to the wrong topic.

    * **Change later messages to this topic**

        This option changes the topic of the selected message as well as the
        topic of any messages under the same topic that were sent after the
        selected message. You may want to select this option if you feel that
        some of your messages have gone off-topic.

    * **Change previous and following messages to this topic**

        This option changes the topic of the selected message as well as any
        messages under the same topic that were sent before and after the
        selected message. You may want to select this option to change the
        topic for all messages with the same topic.

4. Click **Save**.
