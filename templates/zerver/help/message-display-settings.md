# Change your message display settings
![Message Display](/static/images/help/message-display-settings.png)

By default, messages in Zulip are displayed in English with a 12-hour timestamp, and the user list is displayed on the right side of the window.

However, there are a few reasons you might want to modify your message display settings. For example, you may want to do this if you speak a non-English language as your first language, are used to a 24-hour convention for displaying time, or have a narrow screen and want to conserve space.

You can easily change your Zulip message display  settings by following a few steps.

1. Click the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of the right sidebar.
2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu that appears.
3. Scroll down to the **Display Settings** section (after the **My Account** section) to view the message display options.

## Display options
Listed below are the current message display settings that Zulip supports. After editing your message display settings, you will need to reload your screen for any changes you make to take effect.

### Select default language
For more information on this feature, please see [here](/help/change-your-language).

### Display user list on left side in narrow windows
![Display user list on left side in narrow windows](/static/images/help/users-left.png)

When browsing Zulip with mobile devices with narrow screens, the user list located on the right sidebar is hidden to conserve space. If you wish to continue viewing the user list, you can choose to display the user list on the left side.

When this option is selected, the user list located on the right by default will be listed under the **Streams** section in the left sidebar when the window size is under 1165 pixels after the page is reloaded.

## Display time in 24-hour format

If you are used to seeing time displayed in a 24-hour format, you can change the Zulip timestamp format from a 12-hour format to a 24-hour format. You may want to do this to avoid confusion between A.M. and P.M. hours.

When this option is selected, timestamps will be displayed in a 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format after the page is reloaded; for example, 17:00 will be displayed instead of 5:00 P.M.
