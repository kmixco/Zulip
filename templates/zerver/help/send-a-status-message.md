# Send a status message

Sometimes it's useful to specify a status, in order to let other users know your
availability.

This can be achieved with the `/me` command.

```
/me <status>
```

To use it, write the command in a message, with the syntax specified above. If
you don't know how to send messages, you may want to take a look at the guides
on how to [Send a stream message](/help/send-a-stream-message) and
[Send a private message](/help/send-a-private-message).

As a result, it will display a message in the same line as your display name,
that visually stands out from the rest of the messages, and looks like this:

![Status message](/static/images/help/status-message.png)

!!! tip ""
    Status messages are frequently written in third person, in order to make
    them look gramatically coherent.
