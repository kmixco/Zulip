# Add or invite someone to a stream

You might want to add a user to a particular stream that they haven't subscribed to yet so that they can send and read messages in that stream. In Zulip, you can add users to a public stream even if you aren't subscribed to that particular stream, but you must be subscribed to a private stream in order to invite a user to join that stream.

You can add users to streams, both public and private, that you're subscribed to.

1. Click the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) next to
**Streams** in the left sidebar. A tooltip labeled **Subscribe, add, or configure streams**
will appear upon hovering above the cog.

2. The stream browser will now appear, showing all streams that you've subscribed to by default. If you wish to see streams that you aren't subscribed to, click the **All Streams** tab; the tab will turn gray upon doing so.

3. Locate the stream that you want to add a user to in the stream browser. You can search for specific streams by entering the name of the stream in the **Filter streams** search box.
