2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu that appears.

5. To confirm the deletion of your account, click the red **Deactivate now** button. Please note that any bots that you maintain will be disabled.

6. After clicking the **Deactivate now** button, you will be logged out and returned to the Zulip login page.

Please note that you cannot register a Zulip account using the email address of a deactivated account.

In addition, if you're the only administrator in the realm, you cannot deactivate your account; you need to make another user an administrator first before you can deactivate your account.

## Reactivating an account

If you regret deactivating your account, you can ask a Zulip realm administrator to [reactivate](/help/deactivate-reactivate#reactivate-a-user) your account.
