# Delete a stream

In Zulip, most of the stream administration is done on the
subscription page.  Nevertheless, that is not the case for deleting a
stream.  Follow these instructions to learn how it is done.

## Locate the administration tab

Only Zulip administrators may delete streams.  To delete a stream,
click the gear (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) at your top right
corner.  Select the "Administration" tab.

Once on the administration page, first you should click on the
**Streams Deletion** tab. Now you should be able to see a list of all the
streams that can be deleted. Search for the stream you want to delete and
click the **Delete Stream** button.

A confirmation window will appear.

Once you are ready to delete your stream, and aware of **all** the
**consequences**, since this operation is not reversible.  You can
confirm the deletion of that stream.  Once you click the **Yes, delete
this stream** button, your stream will be deleted.
