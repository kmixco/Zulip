**[organization administration interface](/help/change-your-organization-settings)**
to delete streams.

1. From your desktop, click on the **gear**
   (<i class="icon-vector-cog"></i>) in the upper right corner.

1. Select **Settings** from the dropdown.

1. Click on **Organization** in the top left corner of the settings screen.

1. Click on the **Delete streams** tab in the left hand menu of the
**Organization** screen

1. Find the stream you want to delete, and click the **Delete stream** button to
the right of it.

1. Upon clicking on the **Delete stream** button, a confirmation window titled
**Delete stream (stream name)** will appear. Click the **Yes, delete this stream**
button to delete the stream.

    **Warning:** Please be aware of the consequences of deleting a stream,
