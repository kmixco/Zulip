## About Import settings

* Accounts are local to an organization; When a user whose email is already
  associated with a Zulip account creates an account with another organization,
  Zulip offers a feature to import settings from the existing account for that user.

## What happens when you import settings from existing Zulip account

* When you choose to import settings from an existing account, your personal
  customized settings for that existing account gets imported to this new account in
  different organization.

* The imported settings are all personal settings that would make sense
  (i.e. are not specific to organization-specific data like the stream or custom profile fields):

{start_tabs}
1.  Your name and avatar.
2.  Everything in "Account and privacy" where it would make sense (i.e. the checkboxes, not your password).
3.  Everything in "Display settings".
4.  All global settings in "notification settings" (not the stream-specific ones).
5.  Your hotspots/tutorial state.
{end_tabs}
