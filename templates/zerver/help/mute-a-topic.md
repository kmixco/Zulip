# Mute a topic

Messages from muted topics do not show up in either **All messages**
or **Recent conversations**, nor do they generate notifications (including
[alert word](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications#alert-words)
notifications), unless you are [mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group).
They also do not contribute to stream unread counts.
