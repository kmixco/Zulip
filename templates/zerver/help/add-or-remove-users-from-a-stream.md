# Edit stream membership

## Add someone to a stream

Anyone can add users to a public stream even if they aren't subscribed to that
particular stream. A user must be subscribed to a private stream in order
to invite another user to join that stream.

{!go-to-streams.md!}

{!select-a-stream.md!}

1. Under **Stream membership**, enter the email address of the person who you
would like to add to the stream.

1. Press **Add**.


## Remove someone from a stream

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, users can [unsubscribe themeselves from a stream](/help/unsubscribe-from-a-stream).

Organization administrators can also unsubscribe *other* users from any stream,
including public streams and private streams that the organization
administrator is not subscribed to.

{!go-to-streams.md!}

{!select-a-stream.md!}

1. Under **Stream membership**, find the entry for the person you would like
to remove, and click **Unsubscribe** to the right.
