# Add or remove users from a stream

## Add users to a stream

By default, anyone (other than guests) subscribed to a stream can add
users to that stream. Additionally, anyone (other than guests) can add
users to a public stream, whether or not they are subscribed to the
stream.

Organization administrators can configure which
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) have access to [add other users
to a stream][configure-invites].

{start_tabs}

{relative|stream|all}

1. Select a stream.

{!select-stream-view-subscribers.md!}

1. Under **Add subscribers**, enter a name or email address. The typeahead
   will only include users who aren't already subscribed to the stream.

1. Click **Add**.

{end_tabs}

!!! tip ""

      To add users in bulk, you can copy members from an
      existing stream or [user group](/help/user-groups).

## Remove users from a stream

{!admin-only.md!}

Anyone can always [unsubscribe themselves from a stream](/help/unsubscribe-from-a-stream).

Organization administrators can also unsubscribe *other* users from any stream,
including streams the admin is not subscribed to.

{start_tabs}

{relative|stream|all}

1. Select a stream.

{!select-stream-view-subscribers.md!}

1. Under **Subscribers**, find the user you would like to remove.

1. Click the **Unsubscribe** button in that row.

{end_tabs}

This method is useful if you need to remove one user from multiple streams.

{start_tabs}

{!right-sidebar-view-full-profile.md!}

1. Select the **Streams** tab.

1. Under **Subscribed streams**, find the stream you would like
   to remove the user from.

1. Click the **Unsubscribe** button in that row.
