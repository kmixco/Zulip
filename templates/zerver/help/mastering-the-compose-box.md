# Mastering the compose box

Once you've had some time to become acquainted with Zulip, here are some
more advanced techniques to use when composing messages.

## Go to conversation

When you're composing a message, sometimes it's useful to view a
different conversation, for example when you're starting a new topic
based on an idea or a follow-up task that came up in a conversation.

In Zulip, the main message view is faded out to indicate when you're
composing a message while viewing a different conversation.
To narrow the view to the conversation you're actively composing a
message to:

 * Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `.`

 * Click on the **Go to conversation**
   (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-arrow-left-circle"></i>) button in
   the compose box
