### Updating your Avatar

1. By default, Zulip uses avatars from
   [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/); if your email address has a
   gravatar, Zulip will simply use your existing gravatar.  Zulip also
   supports uploading an avatar directly in Zulip.
2. Under the "**Your Account**" section, click the "**Customize
   avatar**" button and choose an image to upload as your avatar.
3. Click Save Changes once you’re finished!

### Changing your language

See [this](/help/change-your-language) for a guide on how to change your language.
