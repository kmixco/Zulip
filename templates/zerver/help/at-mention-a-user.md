# @-mention a user

You can @-mention a team member to call their attention to a
message. @-mentions follow the same
[notification settings](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications) as private
messages and alert words.

    **Note**: An @-mention inside quoted text will not mention the user.

### From the user list

1. Click the down chevron (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) to the right.

1. Select **Reply mentioning user**.

### Silently Mention a user

A regular mention notifies the mentioned user as well as lets other users
see the mentioned user's profile. A silent mention wouldn't notify the
mentioned user making it perfect for when you do not want to disturb the
other person.

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

2. Type `@_` followed by a few letters from their name or email address.

3. Pick the appropriate user from the autocomplete.

{end_tabs}
