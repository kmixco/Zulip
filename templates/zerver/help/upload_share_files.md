## Upload and Share Files

The paperclip icon (![paperclip](/static/images/help/paperclip.png)) under the message field lets you attach files, including images, sound, and video. Alternatively, you may also drag and drop files on the message field. The files are uploaded to a server and a link is supplied, but a thumbnail is displayed if possible. Youâ€™ll see the link in Markdown format: `[link_text](link_URL)`

The image below demonstrates what the Markdown format will look like when you upload your file.

If you wish to give your image a caption or title, you may add text before or after the generated link. Any text you add in the box will not break the link to your file so long as the file link remains intact.

After submitting your message, you will see a thumbnail if your file is a common image type (i.e. PNG, JPEG, etc.). A file that is a common image type will have a thumbnail along with a link to the file as shown in the image below while all other files will simply have a link displayed.

Clicking a thumbnail will open a lightbox modal with varying options depending on the media type. Images may be opened in new tabs or downloaded, while videos from Youtube may only be opened (and not downloaded). You can exit out of a lightbox by clicking the space around the media preview or by clicking the exit button found in the upper right-hand corner.

### Link Behavior

Clicking all file links will open a new tab that will either 1. display the file if it is an image or 2. download the file automatically to your computer.

### Sharing Files from External Websites

Images and videos shared from external websites, such as Imgur or Youtube, may have previews generated as well. Clicking previews of images/videos from external websites will lead to the same lightbox behavior described above.
