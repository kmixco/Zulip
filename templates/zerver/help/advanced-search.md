# Advanced search for messages

In Zulip, you can find specific messages by using the search bar
(highlighted in red in the previous image) at the top of your
screen. This feature allows you to narrow your view to show specific
messages using search constraints called **operators**.

Operators are short phrases in the format `operator:operand` where
`operand` represents the criteria that fits the specified
operator. Operators allow you to instantly find messages that meet the
specified criteria, such as messages that belong to a specific stream
or topic.

It is important to note that spaces in `operand` must be replaced with
`+`. In addition, multiple search operators can be used in a single
query by separating each operator with spaces in your search bar. Most
importantly, you can search an individual stream for results from
before you joined, but search results will only include messages from
after you first joined Zulip if you search the entire realm.

## Search operators

Listed below are all Zulip search operators.

* `stream:foobar` - This operator narrows the view to show only
  messages in the stream `foobar`
* `topic:foo+bar` - This operator narrows the view to show only
  messages with the topic `foo bar`. It is important to note that the
  complete topic name must be entered, or no results will be shown.
* `pm-with:foo@bar.com` - This operator narrows the view to show only
  private messages sent from the user with the email address
  `foo@bar.com`.
* `sender:foo@bar.com` - This operator narrows the view to show all
  messages sent by the user with the email address `foo@bar.com`.
* `sender:me` -This operator narrows the view to show all messages sent by you.
* `near:xxxxx` - This operator narrows the view to show the message
  with the ID `xxxxx` as well as a few messages sent before and after
  the message.
* `id:xxxxx` - This operator narrows the view to show only the message with the ID `xxxxx`.

  alert words. You can add custom alert words in the **Settings** tab.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Listed below are some Zulip keyboard shortcuts that will aid you in conducting a search.

* **Initiate a search** `/` - This shortcut moves the user's cursor to
  the message search bar at the top of the window to allow them to
  begin searching for messages belonging to a specific topic, stream,
  view, etc. in the realm.
* **Clear a search** `Esc` - This shortcut clears the search bar of
  any search criteria that was previously entered. This action can
  also be achieved by clicking the **x**
  (![x](/static/images/help/x.png)) icon in the right side of the
  search bar.
