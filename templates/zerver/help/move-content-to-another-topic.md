# Move content to another topic

By default, any user can change the topic of any message. This is useful for
keeping messages organized even if some users are still learning how to use
topics effectively.

Organization administrators can
[configure who can edit topics](/help/configure-who-can-edit-topics), or turn off
message editing entirely. See the
[guide to message and topic editing](/help/configure-message-editing-and-deletion)
for the details on when topic editing is allowed.

## Change topic via the message recipient bar

This will move all messages in a topic.

{start_tabs}

1. Click on the <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> icon to edit the topic.

1. Set the new topic.

1. Click the **âœ”** to save your changes.

{end_tabs}

## Move a message to another topic

When changing the topic of a single message, users can also choose to whether
to move a subset, or all, of the messages in the topic. The options for
selecting which messages to move are:

{!move-content-subset-options.md!}

{start_tabs}

{!message-actions-menu.md!}

1. Select the first option. It may be called **View source / Move message**,
   or simply **Edit**. If it's called **View source**, then you are not
   allowed to edit the topic of that message.

1. Set the destination topic.

1. From the dropdown menu, select which messages to move.

1. Click **Save**.

{end_tabs}
