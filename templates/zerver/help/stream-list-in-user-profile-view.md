# Stream list in user profile view

The **Streams tab** in the user's profile view shows the list of streams
that the user is currently subscribed to. This list respects stream privacy
policies, so it may not be complete, and items shown in this list will
depend on the user's role who is viewing the profile.

!!! tip ""
    When a user is viewing their own profile, he/she will see the list
    of every subscribed stream.

### Organization owners and administrators

Organization owners and administrators can always see the complete list of subscribed
streams of any user.

### Members

**Public streams:** Members other than guest users can see all the subscribed public
streams of the target user.

**Private streams:** Members other than guest users can only see the subscribed private
streams shared by both the target user and the user viewing the profile.

### Guest users

Guest users can only see the subscribed streams shared by both the target user and the
user viewing profile.
