# Stream list in user profile view

**Streams tab** in full profile view of a user shows the list of streams
that user is currently subscribed to. This list always respects stream
privacy policies so it may not be complete and items in this list depend
on the role of user who is viewing the profile.

!!! tip ""
    A user viewing their own profile can always see list of all the
    streams he/she is subscribed to.

### Organization owners and administrators

Organization owners and administrators can always see full list of subscribed
streams of the target user.

### Members

**Public streams:** Members other than guest users can see all the public streams that
the target user is subscribed to.

**Private streams:** Members other than guest users can see only those private streams to
which both target user and user viewing the profile are subscribed.

### Guest users

Guest users can only see those streams to which both target user and user viewing profile
are subscribed.
