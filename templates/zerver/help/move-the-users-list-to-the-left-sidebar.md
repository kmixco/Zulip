By default, the user list is displayed on the right side of the window. However, when browsing Zulip on mobile devices with narrow screens, the user list located on the right sidebar is hidden to conserve space. If you wish to continue viewing the user list, you can choose to display the user list on the left side.

You can easily change the location of the user list by following a few steps.

1. Click the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of the right sidebar.
2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu that appears.

4. Select the option labeled **Display user list on left side in narrow windows**, then reload the page in order for the change to take effect.

    When this option is selected, the user list located on the right by default will be listed under the **Streams** section in the left sidebar when the window size is under 1165 pixels.
