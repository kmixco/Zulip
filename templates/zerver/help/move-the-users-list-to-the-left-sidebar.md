# Move the user list to the left sidebar

By default, the **Users** list is displayed on the right side of the Zulip window.
On mobile devices with narrow screens, the **Users** list is hidden to save space.
If you would like to see the **Users** list on your mobile device, you can
choose to move it to the left side of the screen.

You can easily change the location of the **Users** list by following a few steps.

1. Click the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of the right sidebar.
2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu that appears.

4. Select the option labeled **Display user list on left side in narrow windows**, then reload the page in order for the change to take effect.

    When this option is selected, the user list located on the right by default will be listed under the **Streams** section in the left sidebar when the window size is under 1165 pixels.
