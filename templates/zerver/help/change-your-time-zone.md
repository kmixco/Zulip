# Change your time zone

Zulip will detect your time zone based off of your browser's settings in order
to display times. You can also set your time zone explicitly in order to
display to others when they look up your profile to find out more about you.

1. On the left, click **Display Settings**.

1. Select your preferred time zone from the time zone selector in the **Time
Settings** section. The setting will automatically save after you select it.

!!! warn ""
    Changing your time zone will not effect how times are
    displayed. It only effects information that is given to other Zulip users
    about you.
