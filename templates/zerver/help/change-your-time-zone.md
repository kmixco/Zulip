# Change your time zone

By default, Zulip will detect your time zone based off of your computer's
settings. However, if you want to have Zulip display times in a
particular timezone all of the time, you can set the timezone in the Zulip
settings.

1. Go to the [Time Zone Settings](/#settings/display-settings) by clicking on
the settings gear in the top-right corner of the Zulip home screen, and then
clicking on display settings in the left-hand menu.

1. Select your preferred time zone from the time zone selector in the Time
Settings section.
