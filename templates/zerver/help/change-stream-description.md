# Change the Stream Description

On Zulip, stream descriptions allow you to describe the purpose a stream serves. Given their optional status, legacy streams or streams initiated without descriptions will by default have a blank description. Updating an existing or blank description can be done by navigating the stream settings panel.

## Change the description of an existing stream
To change the description of an existing stream, locate the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) next to **Streams** in your left sidebar. A tooltip labeled **Subscribe, add, or configure streams** will appear.

After clicking the cog, a modal with an overview of all existing streams will pop up.

To change a description of a stream, first click on the name of the stream you want to change the description of. After selecting a stream, a list of settings should appear in the right side of the panel under "Stream Settings." Scroll down to the administrator settings area to see the option to change the stream's description.

Once the stream description field is selected, type in the new stream description. Note that the description has a maximum character limit of 1024 characters.

If your description is valid and complete, click the "Change stream description" button to save your changes.
