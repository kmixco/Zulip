# **Private Message**
## There are two ways to send a Private Message :
### Way 1:
* To submit a new private message, first click on the ![private message](/static/images/help/private-message.png) button located at the bottom of your screen.

* ![New stream message](/static/images/help/private-box.png) box will appear.

* In the **one or more people...** field, input the username or email address of the user you want to privately message.
When you begin typing an email address or username, autocomplete suggestions will appear.

* If you attempt to input a nonexistent username or email address, an error message will appear.

* Once you have selected the user you want to message, enter your message in the box labeled
**Compose your message here...** or messaging box.

### Way 2:
+ You also can click on the **user's name** in the `USERS` panel on the right and click on `down arrow` that
gets visible when hovering over the name and click on the option `Compose a private message to <user's name>`
and write the message in the messaging box.

You can always delete your message by clicking the **x** (![x](/static/images/help/x.png)) icon located at the top-right corner of your messaging box.
