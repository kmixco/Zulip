# Require topics in stream messages

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, users are not required to specify a topic in stream messages; if a
user sends a message without a topic, the message's topic is displayed as
**(no topic)**. Any other user can then edit the topic of such a message to
set a topic, even if [topic editing](/help/restrict-topic-editing) is
otherwise off.

You can instead choose to require a topic for new stream messages.

2. Under **Message feed**, select **Require topics in messages to streams**.
