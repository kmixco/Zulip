{% if no_account_in_realm %}
Someone (possibly you) requested a password reset email for
{{ email }} on {{ realm_uri }}, but
{{ email }} does not have an active account in
{{ realm_uri }}.
{% if account_exists_another_realm %}
However, {{ email }} does have an active account in
{{ user.realm.uri }} organization; you can try
logging in or resetting your password there.
{% endif %}
{% else %}
Psst. Word on the street is that you need a new password, {{ email }}.

It's all good. Follow the link below and we'll take care of the rest:

{{ reset_url }}

{% endif %}
Thanks,
