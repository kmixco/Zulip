Hi there,

Welcome to Zulip! A few tips to get you started:

* Zulip works best when it's always open, so we suggest pinning a browser
tab or downloading our desktop and mobile apps (https://zulipchat.com/apps).

You'll need an Organization URL when installing the apps. That's
{{ realm_uri }}

* Become a Zulip pro with a few keyboard shortcuts:
  n: Next unread thread
  r: Reply to message under the blue box
  c: Start a new topic

* Give our guide for new {{ user_role_group }} ({{ getting_started_link }})
  a spin.

* Zulip combines the real-time ease of chat with the threaded organization
  of email. Zulip is about productivity---making communication fun and
  easy, while avoiding the distracting and disorganized conversations of
  chatrooms. We hope you love using Zulip as much as we do.

Cheers,
Team Zulip
