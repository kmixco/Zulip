Hi there,

Welcome to Zulip!

Zulip is the team communication solution that combines the real-time ease of chat with the threaded organization of email. At its core, Zulip is about productivity -- making communication fun and easy, while avoiding the distracting and disorganized conversations of chatrooms. As an open-source project, we’re also all about building community, and we're happy that you’re here.

You've come at an exciting time. The Zulip project has experienced incredible growth in its codebase and developer community these past few months, with over 150 contributors on our most recent release (https://blog.zulip.org/2017/06/06/zulip-server-1-6-released/), making it the largest and fastest-growing open source chat product. With hundreds of integrations, powerful search, keyboard navigation, and more, Zulip is designed for efficient communication from the ground up.

We hope you love using Zulip as much as we do. If you have any feedback or want to see how we use Zulip for managing the Zulip project, swing by chat.zulip.org and say hi!

Cheers,
Team Zulip
