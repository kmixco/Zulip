Hi there,

Welcome to Zulip!

Zulip is the workplace communication solution that combines the real-time nature of chat with the topic-based organization of email, avoiding the distraction and disorganization of products like Slack and Hipchat. Our mission to build the best tool for collaboration. As an open-source software project, Zulip is about community, and we're happy to have you with us.

You've come at an exciting time. Zulip has experienced incredible growth in its codebase and developer community these past few months, with over 150 contributors on our most recent release (https://blog.zulip.org/2017/06/06/zulip-server-1-6-released/), making it the largest and fastest-growing open source chat product. With @-mentions, integrations, robust search, and more, Zulip has all the features your team needs. You should also check out our beta apps, a mobile app for iOS/Android and a desktop app for Linux/Mac/Windows: {{ realm_uri }}/apps.

We hope you love using Zulip as much as we do. If you have any feedback or want to see how we use Zulip for managing a large project, swing by chat.zulip.org and say hi!

Thanks,
The Zulip Team
