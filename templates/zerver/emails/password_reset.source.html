        Someone (possibly you) requested a password reset email for {{ email }}
        on {{ realm_uri }}, but {{ email }} does not have an
        active account in {{ realm_uri }}.

        {% if account_exists_another_realm %}
        However, {{ email }} does have an active account in the {{ user.realm.uri }}
        organization; you can try logging in or resetting your password there.
        {% endif %}
    {% else %}
        Psst. Word on the street is that you need a new password, {{ email }}.<br />
        It's all good. Click here and we'll take care of the rest:<br />
