                    <p>
                        Before Zulip, Tim was a founder and CTO of
                        Ksplice, which provided rebootless linux
                        kernel updates (a feat many previously thought
                        impossible) to over 100,000 production
                        servers. He was also the youngest ever
                        Architect at Oracle, one of the most senior
                        engineers at Dropbox and has been active in
                        the open source community for over a
                        decade. Tim has three degrees from MIT, and
                        lives in San Francisco with his wife and
                        daughter.
