    Zulip supports integration with Perforce as a
    <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4sag/chapter.scripting.html">trigger</a>
    that fires once a changelist is submitted and committed. To do this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Download and install our <a href="/api">Python bindings</a> on the
        server that hosts your Perforce depot. The Perforce trigger will be
        installed to a location like
        <code>/usr/local/share/zulip/integrations/perforce</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        Open <code>integrations/perforce/zulip_perforce_config.py</code> in
        your favorite editor, change the <code>ZULIP_USER</code> and
        <code>ZULIP_API_KEY</code> variables at the top of the file to the
        credentials for the bot you'd like to use for this integration.
    </li>

    <li>You should also change <code>ZULIP_SITE</code> to {{ external_api_path_subdomain }}</li>

    <li>
        If you have a P4Web viewer set up, you may change <code>P4_WEB</code>
        to point at the base URL of the server. If this is configured, then
        the changelist number of each commit will be converted to a hyperlink
        that displays the commit details on P4Web.
    </li>

    <li>
        Edit your
        <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4sag/chapter.scripting.html#d0e14583">trigger table</a>
        with <code>p4 triggers</code> and add an entry something like the
        following:

        <pre>notify_zulip change-commit //depot/... "/usr/local/share/zulip/integrations/perforce/zulip_change-commit.py %change% %changeroot%"</pre>
    </li>

    <li>By default, this hook will send to streams of the form
        <code>depot_subdirectory-commits</code>. So, a changelist that modifies
        files in <code>//depot/foo/bar/baz</code> will result in a message to
        stream <code>foo-commits</code>. Messages about changelists that modify
        files in the depot root or files in multiple direct subdirectories of
        the depot root will be sent to <code>depot-commits</code>. If you'd
        prefer different behavior, such as all commits across your depot going
        to one stream, change it now in <code>zulip_perforce_config.py</code>.
        Make sure that everyone interested in getting these post-commit Zulips
        is subscribed to the relevant streams!
    </li>

    <li>
        By default, this hook will send a message to Zulip even if the
        destination stream does not yet exist. Messages to nonexistent
        streams prompt the Zulip Notification Bot to inform the bot's
        owner by private message that they may wish to create the stream.
        If this behaviour is undesirable, for example with a large and busy
        Perforce server, change the <code>ZULIP_IGNORE_MISSING_STREAM</code>
        variable in <code>zulip_perforce_config.py</code> to <code>True</code>.
        This will change the hook's behaviour to first check whether the
        destination stream exists and silently drop messages if it does not.
    </li>
</ol>

    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/> When you commit to your
    Perforce depot the team can see updates in real time in
