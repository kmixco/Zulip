Zulip supports using Webex as its video call provider.

### Using Webex

1. Select Webex as the organization's [video call provider](/help/start-a-call#changing-your-organizations-video-call-provider).

1. Zulip's [call button](/help/start-a-call) will now create meetings
   using Webex.

The first time a user clicks the call button, they will be prompted to
link their Webex account with their Zulip account.

**Note**: If you are self-hosting, you will need to [create a Webex
    application](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/video-calls.html#webex)
    in order to use this integration.
