# About Zulip

This server is an installation of version {{ zulip_version }} of the
[Zulip open source group chat software](https://zulipchat.com). Written in
Python and using the Django web framework, Zulip has an extensive real-time
messaging featureset, including both group and private messaging, conversation
streams, powerful search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, audible
notifications, missed-message emails, markdown formatting, desktop and mobile
apps, dozens of integrations, and much, much more.

Zulip was designed from the ground up to optimize the productivity of
discussions and real-time decision-making.  Zulip's unique model for threading
topics, together with its system for tracking unread messages, make it easy to
have multiple simultaneous conversations in the same stream.  As a result,
Zulip is more efficient than any other chat product for catching up on
conversations you missed while you were away from your devices.  You can read
exactly the threads that are important to you, and it feels natural to follow
up on conversations that happened while you were away.

Zulip's vision is to create the world's best group chat software, completely
open source, so that everyone has the freedom to customize, improve, and run
their own copy of this essential piece of collaboration infrastructure.

Further information on the Zulip project and [its features](/features) can be
found on the [Zulip open source project's website](https://www.zulip.org) and
the [Zulip documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Zulip Community

Zulip is developed by a vibrant community of developers from around the world.
Every month, dozens of people contribute code to it, and dozens more contribute
bug reports, feedback, and translations.  The Zulip community welcomes new
contributors from any background.  The project has an easy to install
development environment, an extensive test suite, and
[over 100,000 words of developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to make it easy for new contributors to contribute effectively to the project.

## Early history

Zulip was originally developed by Zulip, Inc., a small startup in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.  Zulip, Inc. was founded by the MIT team that previously created
[Ksplice](https://www.ksplice.com), software for live-patching a running Linux
kernel. Zulip was inspired by the [Barnowl](https://barnowl.mit.edu/) client
for the [Zephyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(protocol)) protocol, and
the incredible community that Zephyr supported at MIT.

Zulip, Inc. was acquired by Dropbox in early 2014, while the product was still
in private beta.  Zulip's beta users
[loved Zulip's unique user experience][recurse_post]
and continued using it, despite the fact that the product was not being
actively developed. After a year and a half, Dropbox generously decided to
release Zulip as open source software so that Zulip's users could continue
enjoying the software.

As a result, the first time the public had the opportunity to use Zulip was
when Dropbox
[released Zulip as open source software][zulip-release]
in late 2015. The open sourcing announcement was very popular, staying at the
top of both [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10279961) and
[the programming subreddit][reddit]
for an entire day.

Zulip was open sourced with the complete version control history intact because
10 Zulip users visited Dropbox for a full week to help with the technical work.
The Zulip community is incredibly grateful to both Dropbox and those
enthusiastic early users for making the Zulip open source project possible.

## Success as an open source project

At first, the Zulip open source project was maintained with just a bit of lead
developer Tim Abbott's nights and weekends.  However, the community steadily
gained new contributors, and has now grown to be one of the world's largest and
most active open source projects.  We highlight a few milestones below:


* By the end of 2015, the open source project was already going strong with a
  community of dozens of developers around the world.

* At the PyCon Sprints in May 2016, dozens of developers got involved in
  contributing to Zulip; a major accomplishment from those sprints was
  [annotating Zulip with mypy static types][mypy].

* By late 2016,
  [more than 150 people from all over the world](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/graphs/contributors)
  had contributed almost 1000 pull requests to the software, and the Zulip
  project was moving faster than when the original startup employed 11
  full-time engineers.

* At the PyCon Sprints in May 2017, dozens of Zulip core developers gathered
  and led the largest PyCon sprint ever, with over 75 developers contributing
  to Zulip over course of the 4-day event.

* As of August 2017, the Zulip server project had merged
  [over 4000 pull requests](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pulls) written by
  [well over 325 developers](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/graphs/contributors).
