{% if attempted_realm %}
This email doesn't contain a password reset link. According to our records
you already have an account on {{ protocol }}://{{ user.realm.host }}, so we
can't reset the password in {{ protocol }}://{{ attempted_realm.host }}.
{% else %}
Psst. Word on the street is that you forgot your password, {{ email }}.

It's all good. Follow the link below and we'll take care of the rest:

{{ protocol }}://{{ user.realm.host }}{{ url('django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm', kwargs=dict(uidb64=uid, token=token)) }}
{% endif %}

Thanks,
Your friends at Zulip HQ
