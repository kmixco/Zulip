# WeatherBot

* This is a bot that displays weather information to a selected stream

* Weather information is brought to the website using an OpenWeatherMap API. The bot posts the
weather information to the stream from which the user inputs the message.
If the user inputs a city that does not exist the bot displays "Sorry, city not found" message.

* Before using this bot, you have to generate an OpenWeatherMap API key and replace the dummy value in .weather_config.
