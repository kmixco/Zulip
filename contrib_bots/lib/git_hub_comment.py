            This bot will allow users to comment on a GitHub issue.
            Users should preface messages with '@comment' or '@gcomment'.
            You will need to have a GitHub account.

            Before running this, make sure to get a GitHub OAuth token.
            The token will need to be authorized for the following scopes:
            'gist, public_repo, user'.
            Store it in the 'github_token.txt' file.
            The 'github_token.txt' file should be located at '~/github_token.txt'.
            Please input info like this:
            '/<username>/<repository_owner>/<repository>/<issue_number>/<your_comment>'.
