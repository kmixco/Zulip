# Pull request template

Here is some more information about Zulip's [pull request
template][pr-template].

* **Title**: Provide a general summary of your changes in the **Title**.
Remember to prefix your pull request title with [WIP] if it is a
[work-in-progress][wip-prs].

* **Description**: Describe your changes in this section in detail.

    * Summarize the changes (e.g. "This PR fixes a frontend bug that made emojis
    invisible in some views").

    * Point to the relevant issue in your comment and point out any previously
    unaddressed aspects/differences between the issue's discussion and
    implementation (if applicable).

    * List any questions and requests for reviewers (e.g. "I'm not sure my
    Node.js tests are good enough, could you check them carefully?").

    * Be prepared to discuss your approach and think of why you believe it's a
    better implementation than alternatives.

    * Post any relevant links (e.g. Zulip thread) (if applicable).

    * Propose followups (e.g. "This fix is something we might want to also do for
    the emoji box") (if applicable).

    * If anything is missing, please mention it in the PR description, so that
    reviewers know what to expect (and possibly also tag your PR as "WIP" to
    indicate it's not ready to be merged yet).  E.g. a "totally untested"
    comment is much better than just not discussing testing.

* **Screenshots**: If your pull request has an effect on the visuals of a
component, uncomment this section and post a screenshot, GIF, or short video
showing of the interaction. This will allow reviewers to comment on your changes
without having to checkout your branch; you can find a list of tools you can use
for this over [here][screenshots-gifs].

* **Checklist**: Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the
boxes that apply.If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
We're here to help!

    Make sure to uncomment and check the points below that apply to your pull
    request.
