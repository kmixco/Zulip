# chat.zulip.org

[chat.zulip.org](https://chat.zulip.org/) is the primary communication
forum for the Zulip community.

It is frequently deployed off of `master` from the Zulip Git
repository,

One of those places is our [public Zulip instance]().
You can go through the simple signup process at that link, and then you
will soon be talking to core Zulip developers and other users.  To get
help in real time, you will have the best luck finding core developers
roughly between 16:00 UTC and 23:59 UTC.  Most questions get a reply
within minutes to a few hours, depending on time of day.

We have a few important community conventions:
* Send any test messages to
  [#test here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/test.20here) or
  as a PM to yourself to avoid disrupting others.
* When asking for help, provide the detailed needed for someone to
  help you.  E.g. a link to a pull request, the full traceback,
  (ideally in code block form, not a screenshot), etc.
* Ask questions on streams rather than PMing core contributors.
  You'll get answers faster since other people can help, and it makes
  it possible for other developers to learn from reading the discussion.
* Use @-mentions sparingly.  Unlike IRC or Slack, in Zulip, it's
  usually easy to see which message you're replying to, so you don't
  need to mention your conversation partner in every reply.
  Mentioning other users is great for timely questions or making sure
  someone who is not online sees your message.
* Converse informally; there's no need to use titles like "Sir".
* Follow the [community code of conduct](code-of-conduct.html).

There are a few streams worth highlighting that are relevant for
everyone, even non-developers:

* [#announce](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/announce) is for
  announcements and discussions thereof; we try to keep traffic there
  to a minimum.
* [#design](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design) is where we
  discuss the UI design and collect feedback on potential design
  changes.  We love feedback, so don't hesitate to speak up!
* [#documentation](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/documentation)
  is where we discuss improving Zulip's user, sysadmin, and developer
  documentation.
* [#installation help](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/installation.20help)
  is for production environment related discussions.
* [#design](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design) is where we
  discuss Zulip's UI design and collect feedback on potential design
  changes.  We love feedback, so don't hesitate to speak up.
* [#test here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/test.20here) is
  for sending test messages without inconveniencing other users :).
  We recommend muting this stream when not using it.
* [#translating](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/translation) is
  for discussing Zulip's translations.

There are dozens of streams for development discussions in the Zulip
community (e.g. one for each app, etc.); relevant to almost everyone
are these:

* [#checkins](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/checkins) is for
  progress updates on what you're working on; usually folks post with
  their name as the topic.
* [#development help](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/development.20help)
  is for help with any development work.
* [#peer review](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/peer.20review)
  is for getting feedback on your work.
