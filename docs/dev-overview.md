# Development environment options

Zulip offers a wide range of options for how to install the
development environment:


### For Windows  : 
#### [Brief installation instructions for Vagrant development environment](brief-install-vagrant-dev.html)
 [Detailed tutorial for Vagrant development environment](dev-env-first-time-contributors.html).  Recommended for first-time contributors.

### For OS X
#### [Using Docker (experimental)](install-docker-dev.html)
#### [Brief installation instructions for Vagrant development environment](brief-install-vagrant-dev.html)
 [Detailed tutorial for Vagrant development environment](dev-env-first-time-contributors.html).  Recommended for first-time contributors.

###For LINUX/ Other UNIX Platforms

  [Installing on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty or 16.04 Xenial directly](install-ubuntu-without-vagrant-dev.html) (convenient but more work to maintain/uninstall).
 [Installing manually on other UNIX platforms](install-generic-unix-dev.html)
 [Using Docker (experimental)](install-docker-dev.html)
 [Using the Development Environment](using-dev-environment.html)
 [Testing](testing.html)

If you have a slow network connection, you should probably avoid
installing Vagrant (which is large) and either install
[directly](install-ubuntu-without-vagrant-dev.html) or use [the manual
install process](install-generic-unix-dev.html) instead.
