# Bug report guidelines

As a programmer, it's perfectly normal to encounter bugs.
But don't worry! We are always there for you.
Please include these elements in your bug report to make it easier for us to help you.


* A brief title

* An explanation of what you were expecting vs. the actual result

* Steps to take in order to reproduce the buggy behavior

* Whether you are using Zulip in production or in the development
environment, and whether these are old versions

* It will be a plus if you mention the OS on which you are working upon,
with version numbers at your fingertips because they will probably be needed

* Do not use statements like (it failed) or (this failed) etc, rather mention
explicitly what failed like (Desktop App failed to produce this) as these
statements are more easy to visualize

* Whether you are using the web app, a desktop app or a mobile device
to access Zulip

* Be sure to report every minute details of the bug like any numbers or symbols
that might be appearing on the screen when the fault appears

* Once you encounter a bug, check if it's already reported or not in the
issues section

* Any additional information that would help: screenshots, GIFs, a
pastebin of the error log
