# Bug report guidelines

Please include these elements in your bug report to make it easier for us to help you.

* A brief title

* An explanation of what you were expecting vs. the actual result

* Steps to take in order to reproduce the buggy behavior

* Whether you are using Zulip in production or in the development
environment, and whether these are old versions

* Whether you are using the web app, a desktop app or a mobile device
to access Zulip

* Any additional information that would help: screenshots, GIFs, a
pastebin of the error log

* Sometimes it may happen due to your system's configuration. In that case
  programmer may ask you about your system's settings and configurations

* There can be many things one do to resolve bugs but instead end up
  doing worse. Instead of it should be reported immediately

* Instead of diagnosing the bug you should stick to the symptoms

* Write clearly. Say what you mean, and make sure it can't be misinterpreted
