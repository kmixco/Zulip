We have made several small changes to our various user facing and admin
facing settings and interface. Most f the work has gone into making the
settings pages more robust and reliable. Some of the prominent changes are:

1. An improved and fine grained settings backend with real time sync.
2. Realm admins can now view and remove members from private subs.
3. Allow viewing and cancelling pending invitations.
4. Improve interface for stream renames and deletion.
5. Improve notifications settings, and allow configuring signup notifications.
6. Allow admins to invite new users as admins.
7. Improve password reset experience.
8. Show weekly traffic in stream pages.
