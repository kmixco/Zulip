We have made some changes to our keyboard shortcuts. Most noticiable to
regular users will be the deprecation of `C` in favor of `x` for composing
a new Private Message. We have improved navigation using arrow keys in the left
and right sidebars. You can now use '>' to quote and reply to a message. As
always, press '?' to see all the keyboard shortcuts available for use!
