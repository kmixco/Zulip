One of the major changes in Zulip 1.8 is the Night Mode. Zulip's default
visual theme has a white background, and the new Night Mode has a dark blue
background and each interface element has been styled for consistency with
the overall theme. Each individual user can now activate this setting as
described [here](https://zulipchat.com/help/enable-night-mode)!
