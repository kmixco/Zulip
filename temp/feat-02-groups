Starting with Zulip 1.8, we have added support for User Groups. This nifty feature
allows you to easily mention teams anywhere in Zulip. For example, if you create
a group called 'mobile', and add 5 members to it, then mentioning @mobile in your
messages will be equivalent to mentioning all the 5 members individually. Cool, eh?

Note: I believe stream-groups are still WIP so didn't mention here.
