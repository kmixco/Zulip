    Our parent should pass in a worker object with the following

        notify_server_start
        notify_server_stop
        get_recipient
        get_current_time
        is_valid_conversation

    See typing.js for the implementations of the above. (Our
    node tests also act as workers and will stub those functions
    appropriately.)
