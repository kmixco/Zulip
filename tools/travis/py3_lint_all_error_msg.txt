tools/lint-all threw some errors in when run using python 3.
This indicates that there is either a bug in your code or your code doesn't
follow our style guidelines (http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-style.html).

The most likely problem is that tools/lint-all also fails with Python
2, which you can check locally by simply running `tools/lint-all` in your
Zulip development environment."

To run tools/lint-all locally in python 3, you must first install
the required packages.  To do that, run `python3 provision.py` then
`source /srv/zulip-py3-venv` and then `tools/lint-all`.

You can also install tools/lint-all's dependencies manually:
It requires six, typing (check their versions from requirements/common.txt).
and pyflakes (check its version from requirements/dev.txt). It is likely that
you already have a python 3 virtualenv installed in /srv/zulip-py3-venv, but
you might still need to install the dependencies listed above.
